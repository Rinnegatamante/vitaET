"Question: 1.2 Can the fonts be included with Free/Libre and Open Source Software collections 
such as GNU/Linux and BSD distributions and repositories?

Answer: Yes! Fonts licensed under the OFL can be freely included alongside other software under 
FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) licenses. 
Since fonts are typically aggregated with, not merged into, existing software, there is little need 
to be concerned about incompatibility with existing software licenses. 
You may also repackage the fonts and the accompanying components in a .rpm or .deb package 
(or other similar packaging formats or installers) and include them in distribution CD/DVDs 
and online repositories. (Also see section 5.9 about rebuilding from source.)"
